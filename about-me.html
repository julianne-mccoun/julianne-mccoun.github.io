                  I'm Julianne, and welcome to my Dev Academy project blog!
                  <br>
                  I'm originally from California and moved to New Zealand when I was 16. Here I spent time travelling and studied at the Univeristy of Auckland where I received a Bachelor of Earth Science. In my free time I enjoy hiking and spending time with my family. 
                  <br>
                  Now I am learning to become a web developer at Dev Academy in Auckland, New Zealand. I want to learn as much as I can to build a new career amd work on phenomenal projects.
