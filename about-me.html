      <h2>Who I Am</h2>

      <h2>Study History</h2>
      <p> 
        I moved to New Zealand for University, where I studied Earth Science at the Univeristy of Auckland. I chose to study this because I really enjoyed learning about our planet and its history.
        While I was studying I joined a satellite building team called Koios which is building a small 10 x 10 centimeter satellite called a Cubesat. This was throught the <a href= >Auckland Programme for Space Systems</a>. 
        This is when I really became interested in technology and decided that for my career I wanted to be more tech-focused. 
        <br>
        This is what brough me to <a href="">Dev Acacdemy</a>! Dev Academy is a 15 week web developer bootcamp. I joined shortly after I finished my bachelors degree.
        So now I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand and am studying to become a web developer!
