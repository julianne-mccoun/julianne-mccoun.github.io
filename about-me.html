      <h1>About Me </h1>

      <p>
        My name is Julianne, I grew up in a small town in Central California. I moved to New Zealand for University,
         where I studied Earth Science. I still have a lot of family back in California; both of my parents as well as
          my dog, Minnie. 
      </p>

      <p> I live in Auckland now and am studying to become a web developer!</p>

      <p> Have a look at what I've learned so far by looking at <a href=index.html>my blog</a>.</p>
