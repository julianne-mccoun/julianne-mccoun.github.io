     <h3>Ethical Decisions - Everywhere</h3>
        <p>
            I’d like to start this post about our values by proposing a couple of things to think about regarding 
            decisions we make each day, rather than large ethical dilemmas. 
         </p>
         <br> <br>
        <p>
            Each day we walk this Earth every human being is making dozens of ethical decisions – they’re an inevitable 
            part of our society. A prime example of this being grocery stores. You walk the aisles – what brand of tea 
            do you buy? The same one you’ve bought for ten years, or a new brand with eco friendly packaging and a tree 
            planting scheme for every ten boxes sold? Eggs – do you buy ones that come from caged hens? Barn raised? 
            Free range? Do you blink an eye? In the same vein, what about meat? How about chocolate? Coffee? Is your 
            shopping cart free of child labour and unlivable wages? Have you researched and considered the implications 
            of the beef industry on climate change? The Amazon?
         </p>
         <br> <br>
        <p>
            When you go to the shops do you bring your own bags? What about for your morning coffee or tea from the 
            local café – do you bring a cup?
         </p>
          <br> <br>
        <p>
            Let’s pull back a bit – if you’re married (or getting married) and chose the ring option for yourself or your 
            spouse, was the ring’s rock collected ethically? Did anyone suffer for a piece of bling to rest on the hand 
            of you or your loved one?
         </p>
         <br> <br>
        <p>
            A final Hot Topic of today is fast fashion – underpaid workers, the overconsumption of water and resources 
            to fuel it, the overall lack of sustainability.   
         </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            That was a little bit of a rant I’ll admit, and for that I apologize, but I hope the general point I was 
            trying to make filtered through – our current opaque reality means that we make ethical decisions each day, 
            even if we are unaware. 
         </p>
         <br><br>
        <p>
            Through self-reflection and conversations with those close to me I’ve come to the current conclusion that 
            my core personal values are as follows:
         </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Health</li>
                <li>Honesty</li>
                <li>Family</li>
                <li>Growth & Learning</li>
                <li>Humor</li>
            </ul>
         <br><br>
        <p>
            Each day I make an ethical decision core values come into play – but I don’t believe these values have the 
            ability to be segregated so that we can consider a decision based on only a single value or even a couple. 
            Our core values create a paradigm through which we see the world. Based on this, I believe that I use all 
            of my core values to make ethical decisions, and I believe that we can only do the best we can for every 
            situation, and training ourselves to choose the best option for every situation, especially small ones, 
            trains us and provides practice for us to make good decisions which reflect our core values in a positive 
            way when we must make bigger ethical decision with larger potential repercussions. Sometimes that means 
            having to make the best decision for the environment, or our family or friends, or ourselves.

        <h3>My Personal Culture and Core Values</h3>
            <p>
                I have my own personal set of glasses built by core values which influence how I see, understand and react to situations around me, as does everyone else. Culture plays an intimate role in shaping these values. Where we grow up and who we surround ourselves with provides us examples of how we should act, what we should find important how and how we should treat ourselves and others. Workplace culture plays a similar role. Is it expected to do copious amounts of overtime? How do employees treat one another? How are employees treated by higher ups? Does communication flow freely and openly? These questions which are often held among employees as tacit knowledge over time will influence how new employees behave as they see what is considered culturally acceptable behaviour. 
             </p>
        <br><br>
            <p>
                I was very lucky to grow up within a caring family who advocated for the needs of others – and because of this positive culture, as I grew I subconsciously searched for other positive cultures, preferring to kep myself around those who uplifted me and who I could uplift and support. These cultural amalgamations throughout my life have helped with the development of my personal values which I believe are a reflection of our identity. I find that the Myers Briggs Personality test helped me to better understand my core values (INFJ).
             </p>

                Health (physical, emotional and mental) is a core value for my host family who I met when I first came to New Zealand. Communication is open and honest and respect is maintained between each other. Physical exercise is one of the best things you can do to improve yourself physically and mentally, and bodies are viewed as strong tools to move us throughout life, and its our job to nourish and take care of them through proper nutrition and exercise. Kids did sports nearly everyday and everyone in the house was involved in at least one style of karate. It was an environment which held tons of energy, and this branched out into the culture of the dojo which I was lucky to be welcomed into readily.    
             </p>
         <br><br>
            <p> 
                Honesty has been a core value of mine for as long as I can remember, but I only explicitly realized this a year or two ago. I believe in honesty because there is really no reason to be dis-genuine to others, and I wouldn’t want to hurt or be hurt by lies. I suppose this ties back to the old adage we’ve all heard as kids: ‘treat others how you would like to be treated’.
             </p>
          <br><br>
            <p>
                Family is extremely important to me. Growing up I was a part of many different cultures – home family, school, friends of many different abilities and backgrounds, and then I took it up a notch and moved to New Zealand, meeting many new people and learning about how they do things. I think the importance of family solidified itself in me as I left friends and family back in California. A large part of this particular core value point is cherishing the time we get to spend with our family. 
             </p>
         <br><br>
            <p>
                Growth and learning is a core value that developed whilst I was in high school; the school itself wanted to develop life long learners and critical thinkers, and this has stuck with me through to now. The ideals they planted developed, and as I considered them more throughout the years I came to realise that I agree with them wholeheartedly. I truly feel that we should grow and learn throughout our life, and that we are so capable of becoming better versions of ourself that there is so much out there in the world to learn that why should we ever stop? Burning curiosity is a big driver – it’s also the reason you find a toddler will ask you ‘Why?’ two hundred times during a five hour road trip (I may have been that toddler – I suppose this core value was with me for longer than I thought!) 
             </p>
        <br><br>
            <p>
                Humor is the final core value of mine which I would like to touch on, and I’ll keep this short and simple – there’s great joy in laughter, and if you can find it in yourself or others, you’re halfway to a better mood and a better outlook on your day.

        <h3>Strengths and Limitations in the Learning Environment and Workplace</h3>
            <p>
                I am dedicated to personal growth and learning, and I believe this will be a valuable asset to me as I work through Dev Academy and then forward into the world of web development careers. I am keen for a challenge and strive to be better. Similarly the desire to focus on personal health will help me to maintain this ability to continue to grow and learn and allow me to enjoy the journey to the best of my ability. 
             </p>
        <br><br>
            <p>
                Contrarily, I worry that that my wanting to learn as much as possible may limit me in terms of depth and deciding where I would like to focus my time and efforts. I feel that these limitations are valid in both a learning environment such as Dev Academy as well as professional environments. I would like to have an in depth understanding of everything I am interested in, but I will have to take care to ensure that I don’t end up with a very large scope of many topics which lack great depth. 
             </p>

        <h3>Collaborative Work</h3>
        <p>
            An example from my personal experience when I found that group work wasn’t running as smoothly as possible was back in high school. I was working collaboratively on a project with others in a class in how I believed was a proactive and productive way, but things were not going well and there was a lot of tension within the group. At the time I tried talking with them, but this did not get very far. I took some time to self-reflect and discuss this with impartial and unrelated parties. I came to the conclusion that I was trying so hard for the project to be completed efficiently and to the best quality possible that I wasn’t allowing other people to work at their pace in a creative and comfortable way. I had to change my style of work and how I collaborated with and approached others. Splitting the project into more definable pieces helped with this and allowed us each to work as we saw fit on our own parts.  
         </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            If the previous scenario were to occur today I would likely want to put in some preventative efforts such as chatting with groupmates to better understand their expectations of each other, group work in general, and the project as a whole. From there if there was still ongoing tension or issues occurring I would like to keep communication flowing freely and honestly in a respectful manner so everyone can feel like they are being heard, and ultimately I would like us to come to a conclusion that everyone is happy with.
