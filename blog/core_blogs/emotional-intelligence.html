    <h1>Emotional Intelligence<title></title></h1>
    <h2>Here I'll explore the concept of emotional intelligence, the core components of it, how it can be developed as well as its benefits for individuals.</h2>
 
 
    <div>
     <h3>What's Emotional Intelligence? (EQ)</h3>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is an entire skillset relating to being able to recognise, regulate, and respond to your emotions as well as the emotions of others in a way which reflects your core values. 
            </p>
            <h4>Five Main Components:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Self Awareness: being aware of how you feel and why, and how your actions and re-actions impact those around you.</li>
                <li>Self Regulation: being able to decide how you will act (and acting in line with your core values and culture) regardless of the emotions that you are feeling.</li>
                <li>Motivation: know your goals and have desire to achieve them - this helps with appreciating feelings of satifactions when they're reached. </li>
                <li>Empathy: being able to talk to and observe others and understand how and why they feel the way they do and respond appropriately. </li>
                <li>Social Skills: broadly being able to understand and manage the emotions of those around you, have constructive and respectful conversations, resolve conflict and praise others to help them feel validated and grow.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            EQ is a skill which we can improve over time. This improvement process has to be deliberate and continually practiced. Some of the ways in which we can improve our EQ include Attention Training, Conscious Listening, and Journaling. 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Attention training is involves practicing in noticing things in the world around you, but not reacting to or evaluating them. </li>
                <li> Conscious listening is the ability to listen to someone else talk without interruption and gaining an understanding of what they were conveying and why they felt the way they did, even without being expressly told. </li>
                <li> Journaling is a tool we can utilise to sift through all types of emotions and process them, rather than bottling them up. It allows us to be vulnerable and introstpective and figure out why we may feel the way that we do. </li>
            </ul>
         </p>

    <h3>How does EQ differ from IQ?</h3>
    <p>
       IQ, or Intelligence quotient, is vastly different from EQ. IQ is a score assigned by standardised tests to assess an individual's intelligence. This relates directly to intellectual pursuits. This score can reflect learning ability, logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial information, and the ability to filter irrelevant information. 
       Additonally, IQ testing is most commonly used in extremely gifted individuals and those with learning challenges who may requrie extra help. 
       <br> <br>
       There's a hot ongoing debate on which is more important, EQ or IQ. 
       Emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly valued in the workplace. A culture which values clear and respectful communication amongst employees rather than the highest IQ individuals they can find would be more likely to be a happier place to work, and in a happier environment individuals could better feel like part of a team and become better people and employees in the long run.

     <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
     <p>
         Developing emotional intelligence has many positive impacts on an individual and those around them! Some of these include:
        </p>
        <ul>

         <li> Create overall happiness increase.</li> 
         <li> Build self confidence and in turn makes you less afraid of changes and risks. </li> 
         <li> Self awareness: you know how and why you're feeling and can maintain balance in life and practice self-care accordingly.</li> 
         <li> A glass half full mentality.</li> 
         <li> Less likely to blame others for personal emotional reactions.</li> 
         <li> Less likely to become overwhelmed and argumentative and have emotional outbursts.</li> 
         <li> Better able to listen to others and make them feel heard and important - this leads to better overall communication.</li> 
         <li> Highly in-tune with your emotions; able to operate in a more optimal state of less stress.</li> 
         <li> A way that top performers differentiate themselves in the workplace.</li> 
        </ul>
         </p>
