    <h1>Dev Academy Foundations: Reflection<title></title></h1>
    <h2>Summary of blog post</h2>
 <div>
     <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
      		I think overall I learned that I am much more capable in terms of what I can accomplish that what I thought I was. Additionally I was able to more concretely define my personal values more succinctly, which I think is a valuable skill especially as I am going to be looking for employment soon and want to ensure that the values of the company I work for line up with how I feel. 
         </p>
     </div>
 <div>
    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>
       As discussed before, the roles of these three factors are extremely important in programming as you need to be able to work in a team environment as well as understand why you design your code in the way you do, to allow for widespread access and accesibility to the technology. 
    </p>

 <div>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
       I think overall I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it! I was already looking forward to it and certainly had nothing against it, but each session I felt like I was enriching how I was able to operate as a person and learning new things about myself and others at the same time. It was a really rewarding experience overall.  
    </p>

 <div>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
       For me personally I think the most challenging aspect of learning core materials was that it threw me out of swing a bit for the coding aspects. I really enjoyed the core materials and I think they helped me quite a bit while working through foundations, but it's definitely a change of pace!
    </p>

 <div>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
		I think Dev Academy puts a large focus and importance on core materials because it helps to set students apart from others in comparison to a uni degree or to other bootcamps. Ensuring well rounded individuals both coding and core wise is essential for hireability as well as their long term success at whatever company they end up at. 
    </p>

 <div>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
       I feel like this time was well spent and not a waste of time. Firstly it allowed me time away from coding so I didn't burn out quickly, and additionally it allowed me to build skills that made learning coding easier, as well as skills that will help me work in a team environment more easily which will be especially helpful during bootcamp and aid in my ability to learn the code more quickly and effectively.
