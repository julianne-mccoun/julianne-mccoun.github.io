        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
        <p>
            While I am at Dev Academy I would like to perform well and finish the program knowing that I worked 
            hard and accomplished tasks to the best ability possible for me. 
            <br>
            I would also like to develop my skills as a person while at Dev Academy. I would like to learn the best 
            ways to work cohesively within a team and be an asset to those around me. I would also like to continue 
            to grow my growth mindset, as this is something I have struggled with in the past. Finally, I would like to 
            improve my ability to readily accept feedback and use it to improve myself and my work. 
         </p>
        <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
        <p>
            Very broadly speaking, I would like to be employed as a web developer within the next year. I would like 
            the refinement of this goal (more specifically what kind of things I’ll be working on) to occur over my 
            time at Dev Academy as I learn new skills, try different things, and see what I like to do most and what 
            I am best at. 
           <br>
            I would like to learn additional coding languages once I leave Dev Academy and have a good sense of 
            Javascript, that way I can broaden my horizons further. 
        </p>
        <h3>Reaching my Goals</h3>
        <p>
            One of my biggest strengths is my determination – I want to complete a working product and I want it to be 
            functional and use the best practices. However, I feel that this determination blurs into a weakness of mine 
            which is perfectionism. If I’m not happy with something I’ve created I will spend a lot of time trying to 
            make it perfect and subsequently spending a lot of time stressing about the task or problem at hand.
            <br>
            To mitigate this perfectionism I will do my best to always stick to the recommended timeboxing allotments.  
            Additionally I have written out the following workflow when I begin to get stressed about a problem or 
            project:
            <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When I encounter a problem, I will spend up to 10 minutes trying to fix it initially 
                (using my Toggl Track timer) and if I haven’t made progress in that time frame I will work 
                through the following workflow:</li>
            <li>Take a step back and write down the problem: Write down what I am wanting to achieve/to work, 
                and write down what it’s currently doing/not doing</li>
            <li>Break down this problem into smaller steps</li>
            <li>Evaluate each step and see if I can accomplish any of them with the knowledge I already have, 
                and complete them if so. </li>
            <li>If I still have problems, I will do a web search to see if it’s a common problem and if I can 
                understand the solutions there. (this step and the previous should take no more than 20-30 mins) </li>
            <li>If a web search is not helping, I will reach out to my cohort on slack for help, and my facilitator 
                if needed. </li>
            <li>After I get the problem solved to a satisfactory standard I will go to my notes and do a quick write 
                up about the problem and how it was solved and include any helpful links/information there for future 
                reference. </li>
         </ul>
       
         <p>
            In terms of support for reaching my goals from the facilitation team, I would generally expect that they 
            check up on the work I do, and to help guide me if I’m straying from the right direction. I think this 
            could be as simple as me sending links or screenshots of my work to my facilitator either during the 
            week when I’m feeling unsure of something in particular or during a weekly check in and having a discussion 
            about that. Additionally if I am stuck on a problem I would appreciate help and guidance there, either in 
            terms of a discussion or ideas of concepts I could try to apply. 
         </p>
         <h3>My personal practices</h3>
            <p>
                I want to set myself up for success, so I have decided on the following set of practices:
            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>I will establish clear objectives for a project or ensure that I understand objectives 
                    set out before I begin work.</li>
                <li>I will have set times during the day which are ‘off hours’ that are for me to take a break and not 
                    feel like I should be working every waking minute. During foundations I’m setting these as after 7pm 
                    so that I can unwind before bed. These may change during the bootcamp section of Dev Academy. </li>
                <li>Each morning I will start fresh and review a list of reminders and write up my goals for the day and 
                    what challenges these may bring, as well as drafting up a rough schedule. At the end of the day, I’ll 
                    revisit this, say how the day and my goals went and write up a rough to-do list for the following day. </li>
                <li>When I begin to get overwhelmed, I will take a short break away from my work to do some exercise or 
                    stretching and to put everything back into a bit of perspective.</li>
                <li>I have a document that I’ve sectioned out into weeks, and throughout each week I am putting in notes 
                    of things that were very good or really tough (and how I got through it) and screenshots of webpages and 
                    code that I’ve made. The purpose of this is to be able to see how I am growing as a developer over time, 
                    and I think it will have a very gratifying result at the end of my time at Dev Academy 
                    (or even a year from now) looking back and seeing where I started out at. I am also hoping this helps 
                    with imposter syndrome related to web dev in general. </li>
                <li>I will continue to work on and care for other hobbies and aspects of my life, too, alongside this 
                    new web development avenue. Examples of this include ensuring I’m staying fit and healthy (through exercise 
                    and nutrition), keeping up with friends and family, and continuing to learn in other areas or hobbies such as 
                    a second language which I am working on learning.  During foundations I would like this to include Tuesdays – 
                    Thursdays from 2-4pm to attend an online class I’m interested in when possible. </li>
            </ul>
