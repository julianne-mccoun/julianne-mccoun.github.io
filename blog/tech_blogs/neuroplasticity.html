    <h1>Neuroplasticity<title></title></h1>
    <h2>This post will explain what neuroplasticity is and how we can engage with and benefit from the concepts of it. Then we'll talk about mindsets - specifically a growth mindset, and how this links to neuroplasticity and how a change in perspective can help individuals achieve goals.</h2>
 <div>
     <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the brains' ability to change itself based on the stimuli that it's exposed to. Repeated stimuli, or practice, creates neural pathways in the brain which become stronger through repetition. Neural pathways are essentially little highways of brain cells which help us direct thoughts and actions. This means that we can have an active part in shaping how we think and what we are capable of. 
         </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the benefits of neuroplasticity allows people to recognize that essentially they are capable of deciding the their future. You get out what you put into something. You can recognize that if you want to be better at something you need to practice it and you will improve your abilities. 
         </p>
        <p>
            I find that the concept of neuroplasticity is helpful for me because with a better understanding of it I can tailor my studying and hobbies to build off of concepts to build stronger and longer neural pathways rather than trying to rote learn everything. Neuroplasticity can also help me as I've had a mTBI in the past and I can use neuroplasticity to strengthen pathways to keep my brain healthy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>There are many ways to increase the neuroplasticity of your brain; a few of them are:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Getting enough sleep. Many deem sleep as the most important factor. This allows your brain time to change, heal and grow.</li>
                <li>Exercise is also held in high regard; especially cardio exercise. This gives your brain energy and help with overall health. The positive mood affects of exercise can also help keeping you upbeat and ready to tackle challenges. Good fitness has even been known to increase the volume of the hippocampus.</li>
                <li>Diet: a good and healthy diet helps support your whole body, not just your brain. It's all about taking good care of yourself.</li>
                <li>Stress reduction: stress inhibits neuroplasticity, so it's important to reduce stress where possible. Some ways to achieve this could be re-prioritizing the weekly schedule, re-working your routine and making small changes to make your life easier (a side example is the mantra I use to keep clutter down in my house and decrease the amount of cleanup I have to do later "Don't put it down - put it away"). Other methods could include tools such as meditation.</li>
                <li>Learning new skills can also help increase plasticity and make it easier on your brain. Spending a few minutes per day practicing your new skill can be very useful. </li>
                <li>Traveling: allowing your brain to be exposed to new places and things can open new neural pathways.</li>
            </ol>

    <h3>Growth Mindsets</h3>
    <p>
        A growth mindset is the general belief that you can improve yourself and your abilities and become smarter or more talented at an activity through learning and practice. This contrasts with a  fixed mindset where the belief is that abilities and intelligence is static and unchanging. I believe that a growth mindset is essential an extension of the understanding of neuroplasticity; when we understand neuroplasticity we know that our abilities are not pre-determined, and a growth mindset is the implementation this knowledge throughout your life; reminders that you are growing and can become better by strengthening these neural pathways through methods to increase neuroplasticity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the big difference between growth and fixed mindsets is the hope that a growth mindset gives to those who believe in it. If you believe you can do anything, learn anything, with only the limits of your willpower holding you back, then you're a whole lot more likely to give it a go and work on it rather than give up because you think you're as good as you're going to get. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This type of mindset would be revolutionary for anyone to learn. It increases intrinsic motivation. It also helps you accomplish challenges more readily; a core component of the growth mindset is that challenges are there to help you grow, not simply to test you. Getting things incorrect is how you can improve yourself. One of my personal favorite quotes is "Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new". This keeps me going so much of the time when I am struggling with a task. It reminds me that things will be difficult but I can persevere and by getting things wrong I am learning new things and growing as a person. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I had an in-depth read of neuroplasticity and growth mindsets prior to the start of foundations, and I think that the most surprising thing for me is how comforting the concepts have become for me, especially in times of difficulty. When signing up for Dev Academy I had a great deal of anxiety because I thought that I wasn't smart enough to learn how to code and wouldn't make it through. Knowing that I can grow and improve myself pushes me to do more, learn more, accomplish more. The only thing in my way is my own willpower. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Integrating a growth mindset is important for success; I've accidently developed a solid morning routine throughout the first three weeks of foundations. I wake up at 7, do some stretching my skincare routine, have my breakfast  and sit down at my computer to begin work. The first thing I do when I sit down is look at my daily plan and fill out the goals I want to accomplish for the day and the associated challenges with these. Finally right before I begin diving in for the day I read through a list of notes I keep to remind myself about the growth mindset and neuroplasticity principles; as cheesy as they are and as much I debated writing any of them in my blog, here are a few snippets:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.</li>
        <li>You have to practice who you want to be. </li>
        <li>It's not about motivation, it's about willpower. </li>
        <li>Growth mindset - we improve over time. Challenges mean we are learning and growing and becoming better.  The brain is malleable and able to grow and improve abilities. This mindset sees failures and challenges as opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
        <li>Not Hard --> an opportunity for growth.</li>
        <li>Make coding a habit. </li>
        <li>Abilities are not static and fixed. I will embrace this growth mindset by consciously leaning into challenges, and specifically seeking them out and renaming them in my brain from 'hard' to 'an opportunity for growth'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally when I get really stuck on a piece of code or whatnot I've occasionally turned back to this list or taken a moment to stretch and go for a walk to remind myself that I am learning and the struggle is part of the process. This helps keep me calm and not get overwhelmed in the stress of it.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <p>It's important to incorportate neuroplasticity and a growth mind into learning plans. These understandings are already helping me, and have been for the past few weeks. I think the biggest changes for me will come outside of my Dev Academy timeboxed time, and will be implemented in my day to day life. I ensure I get enough sleep, have a healthy diet and proper exercise each day which I find very helpful. It also makes me feel better as a person which makes it easier to go through each day. Language learning has been shown to help neuroplasticity, and I am already working on learning an additional language. I am also working on learning to meditate to work on mediating emotions and working to improve my emotional intelligence. Finally I remind myself of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset each day before I begin working. </p>
