    <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays VS Objects</h3>
    <h4>Objects</h4>
     <p>An object is a type of data in Javascript which stores data in a structured way and can represent real world objects. To access and modify the data in an object, you use the object's <u>properties</u>. To declare a new object, you first use the variable keyword, and then type the object's name followed by the equals sign (=), and then an open curly bracket {. For each property you name the property and then put a colon and then the property value. This value must be in quotes if it is a string. If this value is another object then you have a complex object. Check out an exmple of an object below.  </p> 

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/obj-example.PNG" alt="An example of an object structure in javascript" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>We access objects via bracket or dot notation. We'll use an example of re-assigning a value of an object. Say that I now decided that my third favorite food isn't chicken nuggies, but it's actually cheerios. To access and re-assign chicken nuggies, I do the following:   </p>
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/reassign-obj.PNG" alt="How to reassign an object value using dot notation." class="jsfundimgs">
      <p>This is called dot notation; it has the object's name, then a dot, then the property, then equal to the new value. If the property has more than one word, we have to use bracket notation. Say we want to re-assign leeks to the fourth favourite property: </p>

   <h3>Functions & why we need them</h3>
      <p>
         A function in Javascript can be simple or complex, it's all up to the developer! 
         The basic purpose of a function is to group statements togeter to save us time and energy by allowing us to re-use our code! They also help us comply with the DRY principle in programming, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.
      </p>

      <p>

         For example, if you wanted to print all of the names of your friends to your console, you could write a <code>console.log()</code> statement for each of your friends, and print it out that way one at a time:
      </p>
    
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/lognames-js.PNG" alt="Console log messages of friends names in a javascript file" class="jsfundimgs">
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/lognames-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of friends names" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>
         What if we could make something to print out the names for us? This is where our functions come in! Below you can see an array of my friend's names, and a function I made called <code>printNamess</code> to print out the name of every object in an array for the given array that you indicate when you call the function.  You can see the console messages on the right; they're the same as with the <code>console.log()</code> statements!
      </p>

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namesfunction-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of friends names using function" class="jsfundimgs">
  
      <p>
         The great thing about functions is that now we can use this function to print out any array by calling it with the arrays name as the argument. Have a look at an example of this below where I printed out an array of my pet's names.
      </p>
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namespets-js.PNG" alt="Function called printNames with a for loop in it in a javascript file printing out an array called myPets" class="jsfundimgs">
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namespets-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of myPets names using function" class="jsfundimgs">

      
      <p>
         When creating a function, we declare the word function, the function's name, and then parenthesis after with any arguments for the function. 

         To use our function we "call" it; to do this we simply write the name of our function on a line of code and any arguments for it in the parenthesis next to it. If there are no arguments needed for it, leave them blank. 
         Our function will then run and return any output if it's included in the function. 
         </p>
      <p>
         This use of functions can be applied readily to many applications when you're writing a code. Functions are most useful when the code is repetetive and helps us define a block of code. Inside a function we can do things like declare variables, print <code>console.log()</code> statements, create loops and much more.
