      <h3>An Analogy to Describe Differences Between HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
       HTML is the bare bones of your body - all of the individial pieces. Bones, blood, cells - all of the essential parts. This is what HTML is to a website - the basics, the order of it and the basic content like words. Like these words in fact!
       <br><br>
       CSS comes along and makes it all interesting - colors and shapes; some of us are big, some small. None of us look quite the same, and this is what CSS is able to do to webpages. It changes things us and can make it all unique. 
       <br><br>
       Javascript brings joints and tendons and muscles and allows you to move - and more generally breaths life into the framework laid out by HTML and CSS.
       </p>
      <p>Please enjoy this haiku I made to help remember HTML and CSS:</p>
         <p>
          HTML? Bored.
          <br>
          CSS?!: makes it pretty ~
          <br>
          Together: good vibes

    <h3>Explain Control Flow and Loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
    <p>
       Control flow is defined as the order in which a computer executes statements in a script. An example of control flow in our everday life is making breakfast: say you want a nice bowl of cheerios, but you haven't had them for a couple of days. Before you get your bowl out, you check to see if you have cheerios. Yes? Great! What about milk? Yes? Nice! Oh wait, is it expired? Nope? Nice! Now you grap out your bowl, pour your cereal and milk, put them both away, grab a spoon and sit down to eat. 
       <br><br>
       You've just completed a process. A mundane one albeit, but good job!
       <br> <br>
       You have a set list of things you do and an order in which you accomplish them in. You even did some <i>variable hoisting</i>, where you checked to see that everything you needed was present and in working order before you set about completing your <i>functions</i> used to make some breakfast.
    </p>

    <p>
      A programming loop is also something we can relate to breakfast making! Let's talk about pan fried mushrooms this time, because I had those for dinner last night. And let's talk about an if loop, because they're my favorite. 
      <br><br>
      You chop up your mushrooms and put them in a pan with some oil and spices. Here's where the if loop comes in. You look at your mushrooms; they aren't cooked yet, so you miss your if-cooked statement and enter your else statement, which says to stir the pan and wait a minute. This loop repeats for several minutes until, suddenly, they're cooked! you now get to enter the if part of your if statement, which says if cooked, plate and eat! Yay!

   <h3>The DOM and our Interactions with it</h3>

      <p>The DOM (Document Obejct Model) is a data representation of objects which make up an element on the web; the most relevant example to me at the moment is a web page. The DOM is primarily used to allow web developers to interact with, change and delete nodes and the content of these nodes. Everything we can change in an HTML element is a node, a few examples being elements and text within elements.</p>

      <p>Essentially, the DOM allows Javascript to interact with these nodes that are in HTML and CSS and change them; we can use Javascript this way to bring our website to life. An analogy for this is like marionette puppets. The HTML and CSS make the puppet and how it looks, but Javascript adds the strings to allow it to talk and dance. </p>
      
      <p>HTML elements are selected by tag names, IDs and classes. Depending on the scale we want to reach, we typically use one of these three. </p>

    <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays VS Objects</h3>
    <h4>Objects</h4>
     <p>An object is a type of data in Javascript which stores data in a structured way and can represent real world objects. To access and modify the data in an object, you use the object's <u>properties</u>. To declare a new object, you first use the variable keyword, and then type the object's name followed by the equals sign (=), and then an open curly bracket {. For each property you name the property and then put a colon and then the property value. This value must be in quotes if it is a string. If this value is another object then you have a complex object. Check out an exmple of an object below.  </p> 

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/obj-example.PNG" alt="An example of an object structure in javascript" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>We access objects via bracket or dot notation. We'll use an example of re-assigning a value of an object. Say that I now decided that my third favorite food isn't chicken nuggies, but it's actually cheerios. To access and re-assign chicken nuggies, I do the following:   </p>
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/reassign-obj.PNG" alt="How to reassign an object value using dot notation." class="jsfundimgs">
      <p>This is called dot notation; it has the object's name, then a dot, then the property, then equal to the new value. If the property has more than one word, we have to use bracket notation. Say we want to re-assign leeks to the fourth favourite property: </p>
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/obj-fourth-fav.PNG" alt="How to reassign an object property using bracket notation" class="jsfundimgs">

    <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <p>An array is a type of object that can store any type of data. An array is different from an object based on the type of data you ususally use for each. Objects typically represent a single 'thing' with many properties, while arrays can represent multiple 'things' in a group, such as a shopping list. </p>

      <p>Arrays are formatted slightly differenlty to objects, check out the example below of my shopping list for the grocery store which shows a nested array (which means there are arrays within the array): </p>

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/tomato-soup.PNG" alt="A javascript array of my grocery list" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>To access elements within our array we use bracket notation. For example, if I wanted to accesss and change the number of tomatoes I need from the store in my array to 20, I would use: </p>

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/20-tomatoes.PNG" alt="Updating a value in my array" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>It's important to remember that arrays are zero indexed, so the first item is item 0, the second item is item 1, and so on. </p>

   <h3>Functions & why we need them</h3>
      <p>
         A function in Javascript can be simple or complex, it's all up to the developer! 
         The basic purpose of a function is to group statements togeter to save us time and energy by allowing us to re-use our code! They also help us comply with the DRY principle in programming, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.
      </p>

      <p>

         For example, if you wanted to print all of the names of your friends to your console, you could write a <code>console.log()</code> statement for each of your friends, and print it out that way one at a time:
      </p>
    
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/lognames-js.PNG" alt="Console log messages of friends names in a javascript file" class="jsfundimgs">
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/lognames-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of friends names" class="jsfundimgs">

      <p>
         What if we could make something to print out the names for us? This is where our functions come in! Below you can see an array of my friend's names, and a function I made called <code>printNamess</code> to print out the name of every object in an array for the given array that you indicate when you call the function.  You can see the console messages on the right; they're the same as with the <code>console.log()</code> statements!
      </p>

      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namesfunction-js.PNG" alt="Function called printNames with a for loop in it in a javascript file printing an array called myFriends" class="jsfundimgs">
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namesfunction-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of friends names using function" class="jsfundimgs">
  
      <p>
         The great thing about functions is that now we can use this function to print out any array by calling it with the arrays name as the argument. Have a look at an example of this below where I printed out an array of my pet's names.
      </p>
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namespets-js.PNG" alt="Function called printNames with a for loop in it in a javascript file printing out an array called myPets" class="jsfundimgs">
      <img src="../../styles/Images/js-fundamentals blog/namespets-console.PNG" alt="Console messages of myPets names using function" class="jsfundimgs">

      
      <p>
         When creating a function, we declare the word function, the function's name, and then parenthesis after with any arguments for the function. 

         To use our function we "call" it; to do this we simply write the name of our function on a line of code and any arguments for it in the parenthesis next to it. If there are no arguments needed for it, leave them blank. 
         Our function will then run and return any output if it's included in the function. 
         </p>
      <p>
         This use of functions can be applied readily to many applications when you're writing a code. Functions are most useful when the code is repetetive and helps us define a block of code. Inside a function we can do things like declare variables, print <code>console.log()</code> statements, create loops and much more.
